# C Binary Trees project

This is a project on the basics of Binary Trees to be completed in teams of 2 people.

**Authors**: Ricardo Sanchez & Emmanuel Torres

## 0. New Node (Mandatory)
Write a function that creates a new node for a binary tree.

## 1. Insert Left (Mandatory)
Write a function that inserts a node as the left child of another node.

## 2. Insert Right (Mandatory)
Write a function that inserts a node as the right child of another node.

## 3. Delete (Mandatory)
Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree.

## 4. Is Leaf (Mandatory)
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf (has no children).

## 5. Is Root (Mandatory)
Write a function that checks if a given node is the root of the tree.

## 6. Pre-order Traversal (Mandatory)
Write a function that traverses a binary tree using pre-order traversal.

## 7. In-order Traversal (Mandatory)
Write a function that traverses a binary tree using in-order traversal.

## 8. Post-order Traversal (Mandatory)
Write a function that traverses a binary tree using post-order traversal.

## 9. Height (Mandatory)
Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree.

## 10. Depth (Mandatory)
Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.

## 11. Size (Mandatory)
Write a function that measures the size (number of nodes) of a binary tree.

## 12. Leaves (Mandatory)
Write a function that counts the number of leaves in a binary tree.

## 13. Nodes (Mandatory)
Write a function that counts the number of nodes with at least one child in a binary tree.

## 14. Balance Factor (Mandatory)
Write a function that calculates the balance factor of a binary tree.

## 15. Is Full (Mandatory)
Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full.

## 16. Is Perfect (Mandatory)
Write a function that checks if a binary tree is perfect.

## 17. Sibling (Mandatory)
Write a function that finds the sibling of a node in a binary tree.

## 18. Uncle (Mandatory)
Write a function that finds the uncle of a node in a binary tree.
